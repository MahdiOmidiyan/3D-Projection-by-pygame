# 3D-Projection-by-pygame

This script enables projecting 3d defined object onto screen while being able to rotate and move them along the screen. The core of the script is the translation between the rotating coordinates of objects and the fixed screen coordinates.

Pygame library has been utilized for drawing lines in order to create projected views on the screen.

A cube has been used for demonstration but more 3d objects can be defined. By using arrow key, objects will rotate about screen axes. And also, by dragging mouse over screen object will be moved.
